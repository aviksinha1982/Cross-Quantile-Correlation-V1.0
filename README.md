The codes are for computing Cross-Quantile Correlation and Partial Cross-Quantile Correlation. The code is developed following the Unconditional Quantile decomposition principle of Firpo et al. (2008).

The codes are made for 19 quantiles. The codes use VBA Macro-MATLAB integration. First, the Cross-Quantile Correlations/Partial Cross-Quantile Correlations and respective p-values are computed in the VBA Macro, and then the Heatmaps are generated in MATLAB. MATLAB will be automatically called by the VBA Macro, and therefore, the user must have MATLAB installed on his/her computer.
